# Takeout GChat Converter
Reads Google Chat data from Takeout and builds a little HTML browser for it.

Requires some recent version of Python3 (I'm using 3.10 for development right now), with tkinter for the UI part (that should be part of a standard Python distribution but some package managers make you install another package)

To run, install Python, then download this program from the Code menu on this page. Just opening gchat\_converter\_ui.py should pop open a sort of ugly UI with all the relevant options.
