# takeout_gchat_converter
Reads Google Chat data from Takeout and converts it to some hopefully useful format

So far it just reads data and makes a summary. Next step is HTML output, then maybe TeX or something.

Requires some recent version of Python3 (I'm using 3.10 for development right now), with tkinter for the UI part.
